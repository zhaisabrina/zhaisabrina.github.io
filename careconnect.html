        <p>Together with Dr. Li, we did a competitive analysis on the currently existing symptom checker apps. I helped her evaluate the user flow while she noted on a couple key points of the medical expertise. Here are some main key points:
            Main feedback: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>WebMD is very streamlined/easy to use, but asks for far too little details from the user and gives far too much information to the point where it is rather indigestable for the user. </li>
                <li>Family Doctor didn't allow much correction for users, which we noted. It also gave diagnosis immediately (almost like live diagnosis), but it wans't really editable.</li>
                <li>Your.MD uses a chatbot which is a different approach but seems to have very inaccurate AI analysis, and often gives inaccurate medical information. The userflow is streamlined but doesn't offer much room to correct its mistake whch can cause the user frustration.</li>
                <li>K health was different in that it used crowdsourced data. It's similar to a chatbot system where it prompted questions and asked for answers but it was more like a questionaire than true AI. It was also long and winded but didn't give the users much information about the actual illness in the end. </li>

    <p>After analyzing WebMD and several other diagnosis apps, we began to look at the holes I saw in their user flow and began to map out the user journey of CareConnect.

  <div class="col-md-7 col-sm-12">
    <p> After we hashed out the user journey, I creaed these low fidelity wireframes to discuss with Dr. Li. Here's the feedback she had for me: </p>
    <p>She wanted some way of indicating when it was time to go see a doctor. We discussed the necessity for this; I had thought it was a little roundabout to use an app to diagnosis yourself, only for the solution to be "Go see a doctor!" instead of directly seeing/calling a doctor. She agreed, and we drafted the user flow to include "warning symptoms" where it simply indicates the possibility that this may lead to something more serious that our app can handle down the road. </p>
    <p>I felt like having this in the symptoms (rather than in the diagnosis - so after everything was over), had a greater chance of preventing users from missing their key warning symptoms (one of the key painpoints Dr. Li wanted to hit on).</p>

  <div class="col-md-7 col-sm-12">
    <p>After completing the low-fidelity mockups, I conducted a user test before moving on to higher fidelity wireframes. I wanted to evaluate if the flow of the symptom checker made sense, and was intuitive, because it slightly differed from other symptom checkers (from my competitive analysis). <br><br>

        Main feedback: <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Unclear what “warning symptom” and “leading symptom” are</li>
