          <p>With Dr. Li and her team, we did a competitive analysis on the currently existing symptom checker apps using her medical expertise and my experience with analyzing user needs and user journeys. We noted many apps such as WebMD and K Health understand  much medical knowledge for it to be easy to digest. 

            <!-- <ul>
                <li>WebMD is very streamlined/easy to use, but asks for far too little details from the user and gives far too much information to the point where it is rather indigestable for the user. </li>
                <li>Family Doctor didn't allow much correction for users, which we noted. It also gave diagnosis immediately (almost like live diagnosis), but it wans't really editable.</li>
                <li>Your.MD uses a chatbot which is a different approach but seems to have very inaccurate AI analysis, and often gives inaccurate medical information. The userflow is streamlined but doesn't offer much room to correct its mistake whch can cause the user frustration.</li>
                <li>K health was different in that it used crowdsourced data. It's similar to a chatbot system where it prompted questions and asked for answers but it was more like a questionaire than true AI. It was also long and winded but didn't give the users much information about the actual illness in the end. </li>

   <p>After creating my paper prototypes, I discussed with Dr. Li on the full user process. She wanted to have some kind of indication from the app to notify the user when it is time to see a doctor. We discussed the necessity for this; I had thought it was a little roundabout to use an app to diagnosis yourself, only for the solution to be "Go see a doctor!" instead of directly seeing/calling a doctor.<!--  She agreed, and we drafted the user flow to include "warning symptoms" where it simply indicates the possibility that this may lead to something more serious that our app can handle down the road. We also limited the functions of the app so that users couldn't input details beyond a certain point, alluding to that if you are beyond the scope of our app, that it is probably time to see a doctor. --></p>
   <!-- <p>I felt like having this in the symptoms (rather than in the diagnosis - so after everything was over), had a greater chance of preventing users from missing their key warning symptoms (one of the key painpoints Dr. Li wanted to hit on).</p> -->
