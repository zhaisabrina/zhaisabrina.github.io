As freshrep, I always noticed how emotionally present you were in TSA. You would always reach out and ask how each of us were doing, and that's smth I'll always remember. Ur levelheadedness is always smth I wanted to have and work towards. U were such a reliable vp and I'm super glad I got to know you. I hope u come back often even after u graduate and visit us!!!! We'll miss u lots~ thanks for everything!! </div>

TSA mom is graduating and that’s such a crazy thought :( thanks for being so warm and inviting to me during o-week and activities fair; you represented all that TSA stands for, and you’ve helped build this familial environment that we all love and cherish. It was an absolute pleasure serving as an officer with you for two years and I am grateful that I can always lean on you for advice in tricky situations. Thanks for always being level-headed (well, except for with Big catering LOL) and wise and we will miss having you around!! You’d better be back for Carnival next year!</div>

Anyways, I can’t believe you’re graduating! I still remember how you were really the face of TSA for me when I was a freshman and you were PR, and you were SO friendly and we even had that one Love Ramen date LOL (THANK YOU). Thank you for all that you have done for TSA as you have had so many positions and your passion and dedication has been evident to all of us. I couldn’t have asked for a better PR head and VP for being a freshman and an officer (always being there to listen). I am forever grateful for your booth advice also and your constant support :’) You better come back and chug out of the booth trophy next year!!</div>

Everything from the first O-week event to taking care of us newbie freshreps to encouraging me to run for president, you’ve always been there. Even though it makes me so sad to see you go, to so many of us you will always be our TSA mom who showed us what it means to be part of the TSA family. I remember having so much fun at my first ITASA, and I think I’ll never forget when while everyone was buying each other a stuffed animal, Jespar kept refusing for the longest time despite all your efforts hahaha. And hey, since ITASA is in Baltimore next year, maybe we could get a surprise visit :)) I’ll miss you a ton, and good luck with everything you have ahead of you!!</div>

Can’t believe we’re about to graduate, and it kinda sucks that us seniors especially are unable to have one last semester with TSA in person! TBT to the time where you were ~forced~ to share a car with me + Angeline + Darren and you had to sit in a five-hour car ride listening to Darren and I talk about the stupidest shit. Appreciate you for putting up with all this shit, Loved being on the officer team with you and thank you for always helping out when I was culture chair <33333333333333 so sad that you’re graduating but I’m glad that we were in the same F A M and got to spend some high quality time together as a jelly and as an officer woooooooo</div>

You’re a dedicated and caring person, and while I’m a bit sad we couldn’t hang as much as I wanted to recently we had our moments. Helping me and Charles fundraise, being an awesome pr chair, those random booth allnighters the few times I did feel like going, seeing you be super happy every year because TSA always kills it at booth rankings, and yeah good times in general. Thanks for listening to me when I needed it, and for providing some quality memes when you drink. I’ll remember you everytime I need to use a paper towel. Good friend 10/10. Also if you ever are forced to come back to Pitt feel free to hmu I’ll be here!</div>

I did not know you super well in high school, but I am so glad that we were able to become good friends through TSA! I can never thank you enough for randomly Facebook messaging me the CMU TSA Class of 2021+ group and the iconic words “come thru” and I said “Lol ok!” The rest was history. Honestly though, I cannot put into words the impact you made on my CMU life. You found a family for me and always made sure that I felt welcome and included. I know you’re going to continue to do some big ass things in life! I can’t wait for the day I look at the big screen and say “OMG SHE’S MY FRIEND ALSO SHE LIVED LIKE 5 MIN AWAY FROM ME WAOOO”! </div>

Thank you so much for everything you have done for me through TSA and KPL, and I honestly cannot imagine a college experience without you. You have constantly been an amazing friend and role model throughout these three years. From TSA PR to VP, you have shown me so much guidance and support, and welcomed me into an amazing and loving group of friends. I also can’t not mention how thankful I am for helping me and the rest of the Omegas through KPL process this semester, and constantly encouraging us even during remote process. You are for sure one of the kindest, most heartwarming, and supportive person I know, and you will be greatly missed next year. Please come back for booth and carnival so we can get that three-peat you and the other seniors deserve. I love you! <3</div>

Hehe I still remember when you were a freshman and having the chance to interview you for TSA… and then woah hold up, you appeared for AED aaaand APhiO (lmao your old frats before KPL)?! I kept thinking, “wow this girl is like a mini me, I need her in my fam”. I kept going back and forth whether I wanted you in AED or TSA, and I’m so glad I convinced Amie to put you in our fam (hehe #jellyfam has some strong connects for buddy pairing). I’m thankful I got to know you better through all the different orgs we were in together, especially TSA. One of my fav memories with you was when we cooked the Blue Apron meal together #shrimptacos and had a nice long girl talk on my bed. Sometimes it’s difficult to get to know someone when you’re always in such a large buddy fam, but I’m glad we got to have that moment my senior year before I left. And then there’s ofc that time I coincidentally bumped into you on the street when you were on your way to pick up like 20 orders from Oishi by yourself, but ofc the niceness in me HAD to help the littlest gbuddy. You are such a warm-hearted person, and it’s no wonder so many people are drawn to you! I’m very proud of how much you’ve grown since being a little freshman. I know you’re off to kill it in the real world and I wish you all the best! Don’t ever forget your buddy fam :) <3</small></div>
